    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      I’m Azer Magbanua, a BS Information Technology student at Cavite State
      University, 20 years old, from Tabon, Kawit, Cavite. I’m into tech, but I
      also have a strong interest in fashion, especially styling myself and
      putting looks together.
    </p>

    <p>
      I work as a graphic designer, where I enjoy creating visuals and
      experimenting with different styles. Outside of school and design, I
      spend my time editing, playing mobile games, shooting billiards, and
      cleaning the house—it helps me reset and stay focused.
